00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,440
Guess it's time,

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,680
you better plug in all your nightlights.

3
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,790
What's out there, past your darkened door?

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,260
Just the eyes floating up out of the shore.

5
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,150
Hey man, I'm gonna eat your girlfriend,

6
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,620
Or maybe turn her into broth,

7
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,860
la-la-la la la

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,390
Kill a kid, cut em up.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,010
Stuff em up inside of my, secret meat box.

10
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,810
Find my, hands across your body slowly

11
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,180
peel your skin off.

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,290
You'll meet your friends,

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,700
inside the ambulance.

14
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,160
Call into the night,

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,630
to the werewolf.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,430
Give all your blood to him,

17
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,520
stand under the warm street light.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,900
Let yourself be hypnotized.

19
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,500
You're just a little snack,

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,580
and so is your girlfriend.

21
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,140
Hey man, I'm gonna tear your eyes out,

22
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,630
and then I'll boil your girlfriend,

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,660
la-la-la la la

24
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,600
Kill a kid, cut em up.

25
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,680
Stuff em up inside of my, burning dungeon.

26
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,620
I would give you guys a little break but

27
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,650
I'm not Satan.
